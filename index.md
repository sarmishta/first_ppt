FIXED DEPOSITE :



- Refers to a savings account that pays a fixed rate of interest until a
  fixed amount of time agreed upon between the bank and the depositor.

- Compound interest arises when interest  is added to the principal.
  This addition of interest to the principal is called compounding. 
 
        - Total amount one will get if compounding is done is given by :-
 
           A = P(1+I/100)^y
           

  A = Final Amount that will be received.
  
  P = Principal Amount (i.e. initial investment).
  
  I = Interest.
  
  y = Number of years.

WHY COMPOUND INTEREST IS PREFERRED ?




-  The two types of interest are simple and compound. 

-  Simple interest is paid only on the money you invest (the principle).

-  compound interest is paid on the principle plus on the interest you have 
   already earned.
   
-  So, If you want to get the most return on money you save or invest,  compound       
   interest is preferred.

-  According to the formula as number of years(y) increases,the total amount also
   increases exponentially.Therefore, Compound interest is most powerful over a   
   long period of time.
